Alloy Website
================

Minimal static site for Alloy (typed LLM functions for Python).

Links
- Live: https://alloy.fyi
- Docs: https://docs.alloy.fyi

Notes
- Single-file site (`index.html`) with inline CSS/JS; no build step.
- `vercel.json` adds headers and convenient redirects for `/docs/*`.
- 404 page is playful but lightweight; robots.txt and sitemap.xml included.
